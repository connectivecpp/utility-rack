# Author Notes and Contributor Information

The primary author of Utility Rack is Cliff Green, cliffg at connectivecpp dot com. Cliff is a software engineer and has worked for many years writing infrastructure libraries and applications for use in networked and distributed systems, typically where high reliability or uptime is required. The domains where he has worked include wireless networks, location technology, and large scale embedded and simulation systems in the military aerospace industry. He has volunteered every year at CppCon and presented at BoostCon (before it was renamed to C++ Now).

Cliff lives in the Seattle area and you may know him from other interests including volleyball, hiking, railroading (both the model variety and the real life big ones), music, or even parent support activities (if you are having major difficulties with your teen check out the Changes Parent Support Network, http://cpsn.org).

The primary co-author of Utility Rack is Thurman Gillespy, thurmang at connectivecpp dot com. Thurman's first career was in diagnostic radiology, with stints at the University of Florida (1985 - 1990), University of Washington (1990 - 2008) and private practice in Seattle (2008 - 2015). In the 1990's, Thurman wrote Dr Razz, the first application that could display and manipulate radiology images on a Macintosh computer. In 2015 Thurman left medicine and went back to school to transform a life long hobby of programming into a second career as a software developer.

## A Cliff Note on Behavior Driven Development

>I'm dipping my toe (for the first time) into BDD (Behavior Driven Development), using the Catch 2 testing facilities. It's an interesting way to specify and test behavior of the interfaces, and so far I'm liking it.
