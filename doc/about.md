>(from Cliff, 2018) I'm dipping my toe (for the first time) into BDD (Behavior Driven Development), using the Catch 2 testing facilities. It's an interesting way to specify and test behavior of the interfaces. For some unit tests it makes sense, for others I'll continue using the more traditional Catch2 form (with `Test_Case`, `Section`, etc).
