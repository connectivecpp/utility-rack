- Chris Kohlhoff is a networking expert (among other expertises, including C++), creator of the Asio library and initial author of the C++ Networking Technical Standard (TS). Asio is available at https://think-async.com/ and Chris' GitHub site is https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/. Asio forms the basis for the C++ Networking Technical Standard (TS), which will be standardized in C++ 23 or C++ 26. Currently the Chops Net IP library uses the stand-alone `asio` repository from Chris' GitHub account (versus the Boost Asio implementation).

- Phil Nash is the author of the Catch C++ unit testing library. The Catch library is available at https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.

- Anthony Williams is the author of Concurrency in Action, Practical Multithreading. His web site is http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk and his GitHub site is https://github.com/anthonywilliams. Anthony is a recognized expert in concurrency including Boost Thread and C++ standards efforts. It is highly recommended to buy his book, whether in paper or electronic form, and Anthony is busy at work on a second edition (covering C++ 14 and C++ 17 concurrency facilities) now available in pre-release form.

- The Boost libraries collection is a high quality set of C++ libraries, available at http://www.boost.org/.

- Martin Moene is a C++ expert and member and former editor of accu-org. His GitHub site is https://github.com/martinmoene. Martin provides an excellent set of header-only libraries that implement many useful C++ library features, both C++ 17 as well as future C++ standards. These include `std::optional`, `std::variant`, `std::any`, and `std::byte` (from C++ 17) as well as `ring_span` (C++ 20, most likely). He also has multiple other useful repositories including an implementation of the C++ Guideline Support Library (GSL). 

- Andrzej Krzemieński is a C++ expert and proficient blog author. His very well written blog is https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/ and a significant portion of the Chops code is directly influenced by it.

- Bjørn Reese writes about many topics in C++ at the expert level and is active with the Boost organization. His blog is http://breese.github.io/blog/.

- Richard Hodges is a prolific C++ expert with over 1,900 answers on StackOverflow as well as numerous discussions relating to C++ standardization. His GitHub site is https://github.com/madmongo1.

- Vittorio Romeo is a blog author and C++ expert. His web site is https://vittorioromeo.info/ and his GitHub site is https://github.com/SuperV1234. Vittorio's blog is excellent and well worth reading.

- Blitz Rakete is a student software developer who has the user id of Rakete1111 on many forums and sites (including Stackoverflow). His GitHub site is https://github.com/Rakete1111.

- Anders Schau Knatten has a C++ blog at https://blog.knatten.org/ and is the creator and main editor of the C++ quiz site http://cppquiz.org/.
