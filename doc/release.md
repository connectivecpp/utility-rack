# Utility Rack Release Status

## Release 1.0

Release 1.0 is under development, expected in the first part of 2020. The functionality is already well tested under g++ and clang++ on Linux, MacOS, and Raspbian, but needs additional testing on other compilers and platforms including VC++ on Windows.

### Next Steps, ToDo's, Problems, and Constraints:

- The marshalling library needs to be completed.
- The CMake files (CMakeLists.txts, etc) are working for initial functionality, but enhancements and improvements are needed. CMake is relatively new for the Connective C++ team and enhancement requests are welcome. In particular, the dependency management can be improved, as well as options added for sanitizers and optimized builds.
- Code coverage tools have not been used on the codebase.
- The Doxygen annotation is mostly complete, but additional tutorial content is needed.
