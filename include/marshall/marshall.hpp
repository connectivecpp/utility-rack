 *  @defgroup marshall_module Classes and functions for big-endian binary data 
 *  marshalling and unmarshalling (transform objects into and out of byte streams 
 *  for transmission over a network or for file IO).
 *
 *  @ingroup marshall_module
 *
 *  @brief Classes and functions to transform objects into a big-endian binary stream 
 *  of bytes (marshall) and the converse (unmarshall), transform a stream of bytes into 
 *  objects.
 *
 *  These functions and classes are useful when explicit control of every bit and byte
 *  is needed (and the wire format is big-endian). Other marshalling and serialization
 *  designs have strengths and weaknesses (see higher level documentation for more
 *  explanation).
 *
 *  @note The design of the binary marshall and unmarshall functions is a good fit
 *  for a C++ metaprogamming implementation (using variadic templates). In particular,
 *  the primary design concept is a mapping of two (and sometimes three) types to a 
 *  single value. A typelist would allow a single function (or method) call to operate
 *  on multiple values, instead of being forced to call the @c marshall or @c unmarshall
 *  function once for each value (or sequence). However, the first release uses the 
 *  simpler (no metaprogramming, no variadic templates) implementation with a hope that
 *  a more sophisticated version will be available in the future.
 *
 *  The marshalling classes and functions are designed for networking (or file I/O), 
 *  where binary data marshalling and unmarshalling is needed to send and receive 
 *  messages (or to write or read defined portions of a file). Application code using 
 *  this library has full control of every byte that is sent or received. Application 
 *  objects are transformed into a @c std::byte buffer (and the converse) keeping a 
 *  binary representation in network (big-endian) order.
 *
 *  For example, a 32-bit binary number (either a signed or unsigned integer) in native
 *  endian order will be transformed into four 8-bit bytes in network (big) endian order
 *  for sending over a network (or for file I/O). Conversely, the four 8-bit bytes in
 *  network endian order will be transformed back into the original 32-bit binary number
 *  when received (or read as file I/O). A @c bool can be transformed into either a 8-bit,
 *  16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit number of either 1 or 0 (and back). A sequence 
 *  (@c std::vector or array or other container) can be transformed into a count (8-bit, 
 *  16-bit, et al) followed by each element of the sequence. A @c std::optional can be 
 *  transformed into a @c bool (8-bit, 16-bit, et al) followed by the value (if present).
 *
 *  No support is directly provided for higher level abstractions such as inheritance
 *  hierarchies, version numbers, type flags, or object relations. Pointers are also not 
 *  directly supported (which would typically be part of an object relation). No specific
 *  wire protocol or data encoding is specified (other than big-endian). These higher
 *  level abstractions as well as "saving and later restoring a full application state" 
 *  are better served by a library such as Boost Serialization or Google Protocol
 *  Buffers.
 *
 *  There is not any automatic generation of message processing code (e.g. Google 
 *  Protocol Buffers, a language neutral message definition process that generates 
 *  marshalling and unmarshalling code). Future C++ standards supporting reflection 
 *  may allow higher abstractions and more automation of marshalling code, but this
 *  library provides a modern C++ API (post C++ 11) for direct control of the 
 *  byte buffers. In particular, all of the build process complications required for
 *  code generation are not present in this (header only) library.
 *
 *  Wire protocols that are in full text mode do not need to deal with binary endian
 *  swapping. However, sending or receiving data in a binary form is often desired 
 *  for size efficiency (e.g. sending images and video, large data sets, or where
 *  the message size needs to be as small as possible).
 *
 *  Functionality is provided for fundamental types, including @c bool, as well as vocabulary 
 *  types such as @c std::string and @c std::optional. Support is also provided for sequences, 
 *  where the number of elements is placed before the element sequence in the stream of
 *  bytes. 
 *
 *  Application defined types can be associated with a @c marshall and @c unmarshall 
 *  function overload, providing a convenient way to reuse the same lower-level 
 *  marshalling code. Specifically, a type @c MyType can be used in a sequence or in 
 *  a @c std::optional or as part of another type without needing to duplicate the 
 *  marshalling calls within the @c MyType @c marshall and @c unmarshall functions.
 * 
 *  @c std::variant and @c std::any are not directly supported and require value extraction 
 *  by the application. (Supporting @c std::variant or @c std::any might be a future 
 *  enhancement if a good design is proposed.) @c std::wstring and other non-char strings are 
 *  also not directly supported, and require additional calls from the application.
 *
 *  Central to the design of these marshalling and unmarshalling functions is a mapping of 
 *  two types to a single value. For marshalling, the two types are the native type (e.g. 
 *  @c int, @c short, @c bool), and the type to be used for the marshalling, typically
 *  a fixed width integer type, as specified in the @c <cstdint> header (e.g. 
 *  @c std::uint32_t, @c std::int16_t, @c std::int8_t). For unmarshalling, the same
 *  concept is used, a fixed width integer type that specifies the size in the byte
 *  buffer, and the native type, thus the application would specify that a @c std::int16_t
 *  in the byte buffer will be unmarshalled into an application @c int value.
 *
 *  @note No support is provided for little-endian in the byte buffer. No support is provided
 *  for mixed endian (big-endian with little-endian) or where the endianness is specified as a 
 *  type parameter. No support is provided for "in-place" swapping of values. All of these
 *  use cases can be implemented using other libraries such as Boost Endian.
 *
 *  @note Performance considerations - for marshalling, iterative resizing of the output
 *  buffer is a fundamental operation. @c std::vector and @c mutable_shared_buffer 
 *  @c resize methods use efficient logic for internal buffer allocations (@c mutable_shared_buffer
 *  uses @c std::vector internally). Custom containers used as the buffer parameter should
 *  have similar efficient @c resize method logic. Calling @c reserve at appropriate places may 
 *  provide a small performance increase, at the cost of additional requirements on the buffer
 *  type.

/**
 * @brief Marshall a single arithmetic value into a buffer of bytes.

 * @note Design history - originally marshalling was implemented with function templates
 * only. The value added by a marshalling class is minimal compared to the functionality provided
 * by the marshalling methods (or functions). However, the customization point design with overloaded 
 * functions (only) is non-trival when all of the name lookups and ADL and overload selection comes 
 * into play. The decision was made to use a class so that ADL does not come into play.
 *
 * Example usage - marshall an @c int as an unsigned 16 bit value:
 * @code
 *   std::vector<std::byte> buf;
 *   // ...
 *   marshall<std::uint16_t>(buf, my_int);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example floating point usage - marshall a @c double:
 * @code
 *   std::vector<std::byte> buf;
 *   // ...
 *   marshall<double>(buf, my_double);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @tparam Buf The buffer type, which must contain an array of @c std::bytes, and must support 
 * @c size, @c resize, @c data, and @c clear methods; @c chops::mutable_shared_buffer,
 * @c std::vector<std::byte>, and @c chops::fixed_size_byte_array all satisfy this
