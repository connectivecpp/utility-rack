 *  @ingroup queue_module
 *
 *  @brief Multi-reader multi-writer wait queue class for transferring
 *  data between threads.
 *
 *  This class allows transferring data between threads with queue semantics
 *  (push, pop), using C++ std library general facilities (mutex, condition 
 *  variable). An internal container is managed within this class. 
 *
 *  Multiple writer and reader threads can access this object, although when 
 *  a value is pushed, only one reader thread will be notified to consume a 
 *  value.
 *
 *  One of the template parameters is the container type, allowing customization 
 *  for specific use cases (see below for additional details).
 *
 *  If the @c close method is called, all reader threads calling @c wait_and_pop 
 *  are notified, and an empty value returned to those threads. Subsequent calls 
 *  to @c push will return a @c false value.
 *
 *  Example usage, default container:
 *
 *  @code
 *    chops::wait_queue<int> wq;
 *
 *    // inside writer thread, assume wq passed in by reference
 *    wq.push(42);
 *    ...
 *    // all finished, time to shutdown
 *    wq.close();
 *
 *    // inside reader thread, assume wq passed in by reference
 *    auto rtn_val = wq.wait_and_pop(); // return type is std::optional<int>
 *    if (!rtn_val) { // empty value, close has been called
 *      // time to end reader thread
 *    }
 *    if (*rtn_val == 42) ...
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Example usage with ring buffer (from Martin Moene):
 *
 *  @code
 *    const int sz = 20;
 *    int buf[sz];
 *    chops::wait_queue<int, nonstd::ring_span<int> > wq(buf+0, buf+sz);
 *    // push and pop same as code with default container
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The container type must support the following (depending on which 
 *  methods are instantiated): default construction, construction from a 
 *  begin and end iterator, construction with an initial size, 
 *  @c push_back (preferably overloaded for both copy and move), 
 *  @c emplace_back (with a template parameter pack), @c front, @c pop_front, 
 *  @c empty, and @c size. The container must also have a @c size_type
 *  defined.
 *
 *  This class is based on code from the book Concurrency in Action by Anthony 
 *  Williams. The core logic in this class is the same as provided by Anthony 
 *  in his book, but the interfaces have changed and additional features added. 
 *  The name of the utility class template in Anthony's book is @c threadsafe_queue.
 *
 *  @note A fixed size buffer can be used for the container, which eliminates
 *  queue memory management happening during a @c push or @c pop. In particular,
 *  the proposed @c std::ring_span container (C++ 20, most likely) works well 
 *  for this use case, and this code has been tested with @c ring-span lite from 
 *  Martin Moene. The constructor that takes an iterator range can be used for 
 *  a container view type, which means that the @c wait_queue owns and manages 
 *  a view rather than the underlying container buffer.
 *
 *  @note The @c boost @c circular_buffer can be used for the container type. Memory is
 *  allocated only once, at container construction time. This may be useful for
 *  environments where construction can be dynamic, but a @c push or @c pop must
 *  not allocate or deallocate memory. 
 *
 *  @note If the container type is @c boost @c circular_buffer then the default
 *  constructor for @c wait_queue cannot be used (since it would result in a container
 *  with an empty capacity).
 *
 *  @note Iterators are not supported, due to obvious difficulties with maintaining 
 *  consistency and integrity. The @c apply method can be used to access the internal
 *  data in a threadsafe manner.
 *
 *  @note Copy and move construction or assignment for the whole queue is
 *  disallowed, since the use cases and underlying implications are not clear 
 *  for those operations. In particular, the exception implications for 
 *  assigning the internal data from one queue to another is messy, and the general 
 *  semantics of what it means is not clearly defined. If there is data in one 
 *  @c wait_queue that must be copied or moved to another, the @c apply method can 
 *  be used or individual @c push and @c pop methods called, even if not as efficient 
 *  as an internal copy or move.
 *
 *  @note Very few methods are declared as @c noexcept since very few of the @c std::mutex,
 *  @c std::condition_variable, and @c std::lock_guard methods are @c noexcept. It is
 *  possible to declare the methods as conditionally @c noexcept (commented out code),
 *  which would assume that no exceptions will escape from mutex or condition
 *  variable objects (or if one does, @c std::terminate will be called).
